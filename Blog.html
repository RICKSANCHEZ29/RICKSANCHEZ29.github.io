        <p class="text">Today was my first day and it was so much fun! Our teacher, Dr. Clavijo, started the class introducing us to Khan Academy where we learned all of the basics to computer programming to awesome videos and exercises. If we ever needed help he was always there to help us especially since I had a lot of syntax errors at first. </p>

        <p class="text"> Some time has passed since the first day of the intro to programming course and so much has happend. We went from learning the basics to starting the final project which is building our own website from scratch. Hopefully I can dedicate a lot of time to this because I want it to come out really good.</p>
